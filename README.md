# Interesting Website
This is an interesting website for newcomers to start contributing on Github [Good First Issue](https://goodfirstissues.com/).

# Reason to be Interesting
Last semester, I began to frequently make contributions on Github. At first, when I tried to contribute something, but did not know where to start, I found this website. This website helps me a lot to find interesting Github projects to work on, and eventually, me and my friends made a [theme](https://github.com/spicetify/spicetify-themes/tree/master/Flow) on a Spotify customization project call [Spicetify](https://spicetify.app/).
